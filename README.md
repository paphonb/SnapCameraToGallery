# SnapCameraToGallery
As you may already know that when you click the picture thumbnail in Snap camera (CM's default camera), it will open the last picture in the ugly Gallery app.

It's very annoying to me. So I created this module.

This module will allow you to choose any apps to open that picture instead of the default Gallery.
